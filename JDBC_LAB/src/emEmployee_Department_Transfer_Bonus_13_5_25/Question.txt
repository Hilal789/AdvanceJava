Question Variant 1: Employee Department Transfer Bonus
======================================================
Problem Statement:
------------------
Develop a Java JDBC program to update department transfers along with bonus alterations for employees in an Oracle database:

Steps:

Connect to an Oracle database.

Disable auto-commit mode.

Create a table employees with these columns:

emp_id (INT)

emp_name (VARCHAR)

department (VARCHAR)

bonus (DOUBLE)

Within a transaction, insert the following employees:

Employee 1: ID = 401, Name = "Hannah", Department = "Sales", Bonus = 2500.00

Employee 2: ID = 402, Name = "Ian", Department = "Marketing", Bonus = 3000.00

Then, update all employees by transferring them to the "Operations" department and increasing their bonus by ₹800.

Finally, if any employee’s bonus becomes greater than ₹4000 as a result of the update, rollback the transaction and print:

"Bonus limit exceeded post-transfer! Transaction rolled back."
Otherwise, commit the transaction and print:

"Department transfer and bonus updates committed successfully."
